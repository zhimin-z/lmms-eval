| S6P3 | 1 | Limited via W&B integration, no dedicated interactive visualization tools |
| S6P4 | 2 | Config serialization, environment metadata, basic versioning, lacks complete reproducibility packaging |
| S6P5 | 2 | Strong W&B integration, HuggingFace Hub publishing, limited CI/CD native support |

## Detailed Analysis

### S6P1: Package evaluation artifacts
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **JSON/JSONL Output**: Framework exports comprehensive results in JSON format (`results.json`) and detailed samples in JSONL files (`*_samples_*.jsonl`) - see `EvaluationTracker.save_results_aggregated()` and `save_results_samples()` in `lmms_eval/loggers/evaluation_tracker.py`
- **Basic Metadata Tracking**: Includes task hashes, model information, timing data, and configuration details in results - see `GeneralConfigTracker` class tracking model source, timing, chat templates, and system instructions
- **Artifact Organization**: Uses structured directory layout with model names and timestamps: `{output_path}/{model_name_sanitized}/{timestamp}_results.json`
- **Limited Compression**: No built-in compression utilities, relies on external tools
- **Basic Bundling**: Can bundle logs, model outputs, and configuration but lacks sophisticated packaging utilities

**Limitations:**
- No dedicated artifact versioning system beyond timestamps
- No built-in compression or archiving utilities
- Limited trace collection capabilities
- Manual packaging required for complex artifact bundles

### S6P2: Generate standardized reports
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **JSON Export**: Comprehensive results export in structured JSON format with metrics, configurations, and metadata
- **CSV/Tabular**: Basic table generation via `make_table()` function in `lmms_eval/utils.py` for console output
- **W&B Reports**: Rich reporting through Weights & Biases integration including tables, artifacts, and dashboards - see `WandbLogger` class in `lmms_eval/loggers/wandb_logger.py`
- **HuggingFace Hub**: Automated dataset card generation with metadata for published results - see `recreate_metadata_card()` in evaluation tracker
- **No HTML/PDF**: No native HTML or PDF report generation capabilities
- **Basic Leaderboard**: Results can be formatted for leaderboard submission (JSON format)

**Limitations:**
- No executive dashboard generation in HTML/PDF formats
- No compliance documentation or audit report templates
- Limited report customization options
- No built-in visualization in generated reports

### S6P3: Create interactive visualizations and exploratory tools
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- **W&B Integration**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations through Weights & Biases - `WandbLogger.log_eval_result()` creates tables and plots
- **Basic Tables**: Console table output with metrics and comparisons
- **Limited Exploration**: No dedicated interactive exploration tools or filtering interfaces
- **No Native Plotting**: Framework doesn't include plotly, bokeh, or similar interactive plotting libraries
- **External Dependencies**: Visualization capabilities depend entirely on external platforms (W&B)

**Limitations:**
- No built-in interactive dashboard framework
- No drill-down capabilities within the framework itself
- No explorable visualization generation
- Requires external services for any meaningful interactive analysis
- No filtering or exploration tools for results

### S6P4: Archive for reproducibility
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **Configuration Serialization**: Complete task configurations saved via `TaskConfig.dump_config()` and stored in results
- **Environment Metadata**: Captures model information, system instructions, chat templates with SHA hashes for verification
- **Seed Management**: Supports setting and tracking random seeds for Python, NumPy, and Torch - see `--seed` parameter in CLI
- **Git Integration**: Tracks git commit hash via `get_git_commit_hash()` in `lmms_eval/utils.py`
- **Basic Versioning**: Timestamp-based versioning and SHA hashing for configuration elements
- **Model Arguments**: Complete model arguments and parameters preserved in output

**Limitations:**
- No container image packaging or environment capture
- No comprehensive dependency versioning (requirements.txt generation)
- Limited checksumming capabilities beyond configuration hashes
- No automated environment reconstruction tools
- Manual process for complete reproducibility setup

### S6P5: Publish to appropriate channels
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **Strong W&B Integration**: Comprehensive Weights & Biases publishing with `--wandb_args` parameter, automatic logging of results, artifacts, and metadata
- **HuggingFace Hub**: Built-in publishing to HF Hub datasets with `--hf_hub_log_args`, automated dataset card creation, and metadata management
- **API Integration**: Support for various API endpoints through model implementations
- **Flexible Output**: Results can be directed to various output paths and formats for downstream consumption
- **Repository Integration**: Can push results to public/private repositories with proper authentication

**Limitations:**
- No native CI/CD pipeline integrations (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- No direct MLOps platform connectors beyond W&B
- No model registry integration beyond HuggingFace
- Limited webhook or API publishing capabilities
- Manual setup required for most publishing workflows

Focus on factual capabilities rather than potential extensions. If a feature requires significant custom code, it should be rated as Basic (1pt) at most.
